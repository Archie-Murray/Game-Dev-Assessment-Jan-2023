## Project Premise:
The brief for this project was creating a singular level of a game. While making this game we were marked more
on how things were structured and how well the project was implemented.

## My idea:
The project I wanted to create was a 2D top down sci-fi shooter as I wanted to use as few assets as possible
and so I wanted to experiment with shaders, with most of the project visuals coming from a glow shader. The 
second thing I wanted to implement was a highly modular system for a shooting system and for a boss.
